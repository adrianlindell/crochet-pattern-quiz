## About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a fun quiz designed to match a user with a crochet pattern. All patterns can be viewed under the 'Browse' tab. The user is able to save patterns to their 'My Patterns' tab using Google OAuth and Firebase Realtime Database. The 'My Patterns' tab and save buttons only appear when the user is signed in to Google.

This project was developed over 7 weeks as a solo project for the Coders SB Winter Project Series at UC Santa Barbara.

**Disclaimer:** Results are arbitrary and do not necessarily reflect the true personality of a user.
